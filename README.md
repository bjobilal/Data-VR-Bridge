# ROOTOpener
Download the latest version of the ROOTOpener here and learn how to use it.

# Dependencies
To successfully run this app, the following need to be installed on our local device:

- Android SDK Platform Tools
- Meta Quest Link

This app works specifically to format ROOT files into CSV files that can be loaded into an Oculus Quest headset and is tailored to the needs of the Data VR app developed by UCLA Physics VR. The only android device this currently works on is the Oculus Quest. 

# Usage

- Ensure that your Oculus headset is connected to your device and can be found.
- Download and run the executable application. 
- On running, you will be asked to enter the path to the ROOT file you wish to process.
- This opens a new window where you can select the variables (leaves) that you would like to visualize in Data VR.
- Once you have selected these variables, you can click "Create File," which opens a dialog where you can enter the path of your Android SDK Platform Tools directory.
- Once this is done, your formatted file will be pushed to your headset, where you can now visualize it in Data VR. Enjoy!
