# Data VR Bridge
Download the latest version of the Data VR Bridge here and learn how to use it.

# Dependencies
To successfully run this app, the following need to be installed on your local device:

- Android SDK Platform Tools
- Meta Quest Link

This app works specifically to format ROOT files into CSV files that can be loaded into an Oculus Quest headset and is tailored to the needs of the Data VR app developed by UCLA Physics VR. 
The only android device this currently works with is the Oculus Quest. Currently, Data VR Bridge only has a Windows version.  

# Usage

- Ensure that your Oculus headset is connected to your device and can be found from your host device.
- Download and run the Windows executable application. 
- On running, you will be asked to enter the path to the ROOT file you wish to process.
- This opens a new window where you can select the variables (leaves) that you would like to visualize in Data VR. Simply click on the leaf to select it and select it in the window of selected leaves if you wish to remove it. 
- Once you have selected your variables, you can click "Create File," which opens a dialog where you can enter the path of your Android SDK Platform Tools directory.
- Once this is done, your formatted file will be pushed to your headset, where you can now visualize it in Data VR. Enjoy!
