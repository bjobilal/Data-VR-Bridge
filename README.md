Download the latest version of the Data VR Bridge here and learn how to use it. You can find the latest release under Releases >> Tags

# Dependencies
To successfully run this app, the following need to be installed on your local device:

- Meta Quest Link

This app works specifically to format ROOT files into CSV files that can be loaded into an Oculus Quest headset and is tailored to the needs of the Data VR app developed by UCLA Physics VR. 
The only android device this currently works with is the Oculus Quest. Currently, Data VR Bridge only has a Windows version.  

# Usage

- Ensure that your Oculus headset is connected to your device and can be found from your host device. Additionally, you may need to enable USB debugging.
- Download and run the Windows executable application. 
- On running, you will be asked to choose the ROOT/CSV file you wish to process.
- Should you choose a CSV file, your file will be moved to the headset immediately. Alternatively, for the ROOT file option, you will see a tree hierarchy where you can select the leaves in your chosen file that you want to view in Data VR. You can select leaves by clicking on the corresponding name in the central window.
- Once you have selected your variables, you can click "Create File," which will initiate the file transfer process. Once again, ensure that your headset is connected to your device and detected.
- The file processing may take a minute or so, but you will be updated during the processing. 
- After following the steps, your formatted file will be pushed to your headset, where you can now visualize it in Data VR. Enjoy!

If you do not have any test files, you can download and parse the example_bessel_harmonics.csv file.
